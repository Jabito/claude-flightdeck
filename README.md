**A visual control panel for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** — explore your agent ecosystem, run commands, schedule automations, and monitor everything in real time.

Claude Flightdeck turns your `~/.claude` directory into a full-featured workspace. Visualize how your agents, commands, and skills interconnect, edit files with syntax highlighting, execute workflows with live streaming output, and set up automated jobs that run on schedules or respond to webhooks and JIRA tickets.

**Project Owner:** Jose Paolo "Javi" Javier

> **Note:** Claude Flightdeck is a companion tool — it requires a working [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) installation. It does not bundle or replace Claude Code itself.

## Features

### Workspace

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **File Explorer** | Browse and manage your `~/.claude` directory with drag-drop, inline folder creation, and context menus |
| **Relationship Graph** | Interactive ReactFlow node graph mapping connections between commands, orchestrators, agents, skills, hooks, and external services |
| **Dual-View Editor** | Monaco-powered editor with syntax highlighting (Markdown, JSON, JS, TS, YAML) — opens side-by-side with the graph |
| **Node Inspection** | Click any node to see its connections, open in editor, focus its subgraph, or run it directly |
| **View Modes** | Switch between **Folder** (grouped by domain) and **Type** (grouped by category) layouts |
| **Search & Filter** | Filter by node type, edge type (spawns/uses/accesses), or search by name with real-time highlighting |

### Execute

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Command Runner** | Select any command from `~/.claude/commands/`, attach files, set arguments/context, and choose a project directory |
| **Live Streaming** | Real-time SSE output with per-line elapsed timestamps, auto-scroll, and URL auto-linking |
| **Run History** | Full execution log with status badges, duration, exit codes — re-run any previous execution with one click |
| **Interactive Sessions** | When Claude pauses to ask a question, respond directly in the UI with yes/no or custom input |
| **Process Management** | Kill running processes, reconnect to active streams, manage concurrent executions |

### Automation

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Scheduled Jobs** | Cron-based scheduling with JIRA, Bitbucket, or free-prompt sources — auto-triggers Claude commands on a timer |
| **JIRA Polls** | Define JQL filters to watch for matching issues; auto-execute commands with token templates (`{{key}}`, `{{summary}}`, `{{status}}`, `{{assignee}}`, `{{type}}`) |
| **Webhooks** | Create HTTP endpoints that trigger Claude commands when called by external services — supports payload templates and secret validation |
| **Triggered Events** | Unified history of all automation runs with live output streaming, source-type filtering, and interactive input |

### Projects

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Project Browser** | View all Claude Code projects with CLAUDE.md previews and scope inspection |
| **Cascade Cleanup** | Delete a project and automatically clean up associated webhooks, polls, schedules, and run history |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **[Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code)** installed and accessible as `claude`
- **pm2** (optional — `npm install -g pm2`) for production deployment

### Install & Deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jabito/claude-flightdeck.git
cd claude-flightdeck

# Deploy: installs deps, builds client, starts via pm2
bash deploy.sh

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:3001
```

### Deploy Commands

```bash
bash deploy.sh             # Build + start/restart (default)
bash deploy.sh restart     # Rebuild and restart
bash deploy.sh stop        # Stop the server
bash deploy.sh status      # Show pm2 process info
bash deploy.sh logs        # Tail logs (add number for line count: logs 100)
bash deploy.sh delete      # Remove from pm2 entirely
```

### Development Mode

```bash
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
npm run dev    # Starts backend (nodemon) + Vite dev server concurrently
```

## Expected Claude File Locations

Claude Flightdeck reads from and manages the standard Claude Code directory at `~/.claude/`:

```
~/.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # Global instructions loaded in every session
├── settings.json                # Permissions, env vars, hooks, MCP servers
├── plugins.local.md             # Local credentials (Jira/Confluence PATs) — not synced
├── agents/                      # Agent definitions (orchestrators + workers)
│   ├── task-director.md
│   ├── backend-engineer.md
│   └── ...
├── commands/                    # Slash command entry points
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── plan.md              # /dev:plan
│   │   ├── implement.md         # /dev:implement
│   │   └── ...
│   └── doc/
│       └── ...
├── skills/                      # Domain reference knowledge injected into agents
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── docs/

└── hooks/                       # Hook scripts (lifecycle event handlers)
    ├── cl-observe.sh
    └── cl-stop.sh
```

### `plugins.local.md` — Credential Format

Required for JIRA polls and Confluence integrations:

```markdown
confluence_url: https://your-confluence.example.com/confluence
confluence_pat: YOUR_CONFLUENCE_PAT
jira_url: https://your-jira.example.com/jira
jira_pat: YOUR_JIRA_PAT
```

For Jira Cloud (email + API token), configure instead in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL": "https://yourorg.atlassian.net",
    "ATLASSIAN_EMAIL": "you@example.com",
    "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
  }
}
```
